# Marawi interactives migration

This repo contains the code for the marawi interactive project. It uses the Gridsome framework. Most of the content in `src/` is migrated code from https://github.com/theguidon/marawi-interactives modified to fit into the boilerplate created using `gridsome create [site-name]`.

## Installation for development: 

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool (if you don't have it yet in your system)

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Clone this repo and navigate to the directory.
```

cd marawi-gridsome
```


### 3. Start your local dev server.
To run on `localhost:8080`:
